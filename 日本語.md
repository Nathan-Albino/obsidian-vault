### Having も and また right beside eachother

Question:

>What is the difference between も and また?
>
>Context: 山田もまたパーティーに 来ます。
>
>So, も means "too" and the one meaning of また is also "too". What's the difference between these two words and why they were used together in that sentence?

Answer:

This sentence is technically ambiguous; また can mean either "also" or "again" here. Assuming the meaning of "again" is not intended, もまた is a literary, emphatic and/or dramatic way of saying "also".

For example, one can say:

彼もまた人間なのです。
He too is a human being.
それもまた人生だ。
That's also (a form of) life.
(i.e., People's lives are varied.)
もまた is not redundant at all if used this way.

However, I can feel nothing dramatic or didactic in 山田もまたパーティーに来ます, so this もまた looks a little awkward to me. Maybe the speaker had a good reason to 
emphasize the "(not only someone but) also" part, or maybe this また just means "again"
